   * \brief CPyramidalDart is a dart within a top-down pyramid
   *
   * A pyramidal dart contains additionnal information such as up/down relationships.
   * The dart "up" is the parent dart in the previous level.
   * The dart "down" is the first child (also called 'representative') in the next level.
   * For example, if a dart d from level k is split in two darts (d1,d2) at level k+1 such as
   * d2=beta1(d1), the dart down of d is d1.
